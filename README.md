# Multi-group Gaussian process (MGGP)

The multi-group Gaussian process (MGGP) is a generalization of a traditional GP to the setting where observations are partitioned into a set of known subgroups.

The repo contents are as follows:
- `models/` contains classes for GP models,
- `kernels/` contains classes for covariance functions,
- `experiments/` contains scripts for running simulation experiments and experiments with GTEx data.
