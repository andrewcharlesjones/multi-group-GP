# Multi-group Gaussian process (MGGP)

The multi-group Gaussian process (MGGP) is a generalization of a traditional GP to the setting in which observations are partitioned into a set of known subgroups.

The repo contents are as follows:
- `multi-group-GP/models/` contains classes for GP models,
- `multi-group-GP/kernels/` contains classes for covariance functions,
- `multi-group-GP/experiments/` contains scripts for running simulation experiments and experiments with GTEx data.

## Installation

The MGGP software can be installed with `pip`:

`pip install multi-group-GP`
